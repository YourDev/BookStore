                <p>Books Store was started in July 2003 in a storage unit in Kirkland, WA, with a commitment to provide quality,
                    cheap, used books at the lowest prices anywhere. Just two months after founding the company, the first book was
                    purchased and shipped: <em>Charlotteâ€™s Web</em>, by <em>E. B. White</em>, for $4.74.</p>
                <p>With warehouses distributed across North America, we have brought scale and innovation to processing and selling
                    used books, allowing us to continually grow selection and ship even faster to Thrift Books customers.</p>

            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Book Store">
                <p>Welcome to Book Store, the world's leading specialist online bookstore. We're proud to offer over 15 million titles,
                    all at unbeatable prices with free delivery worldwide to over 100 countries.
                    Whatever your interest or passion, you'll find something interesting in our bookshop full of delights.</p>
                <p><strong>How is it going?</strong><br>
                    Book Store is the fastest growing bookseller in Europe, shipping to thousands of customers every day throughout the
                    world from our fulfilment centre in Gloucester, United Kingdom. We have over a million customers and a reputation for
                    extremely high service levels.</p>
                <p><strong>The Long Tail: why are we making as many books available as possible?</strong><br>
                    Of the 30 million titles ever printed in the English language only a few million of these are in print. We are seeking to
                    make available as many of these titles as possible (and working to do the same with foreign language titles). This way, we
                    will have the largest breadth of titles available in the world. </p>
                <p><strong>Publishers and Distributors</strong><br>
                    We want to offer as many books as possible and we are very keen to talk to publishers and distributors about supply
                    arrangements.</p>

            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="TBD's Purchase Terms and Conditions">
                <p><strong>1. Purchase Orders; Pricing and Taxes:</strong> These terms and conditions govern TBD's purchase of Products
                    from Vendor. "TBD" is The Book Depository Limited, a company registered in England and Wales with company number
                    5124926 whose registered office is at 60 Holborn Viaduct, London, EC1A 2FD. "Products" means all goods, including
                    packaging, provided to TBD. TBD is not obliged to purchase Products, and Vendor is not obliged to sell Products,
                    until Vendor acknowledges an order file issued by TBD ("OF"). Vendor will not substitute Products or combine or
                    consolidate OFs without TBD's consent. Documents that TBD signs acknowledging receipt of Products do not constitute
                    acceptance of the Products. TBD may modify or cancel OFs without penalty before the Vendor delivers the Products
                    (such delivery in accordance with section 7). The Product price on the OF prevails over any list or invoice price.
                    Prices include applicable fees, taxes (excluding VAT / GST as the case may be), duties, levies, commissions and other
                    charges, unless otherwise agreed in writing. If Vendor reduces the price of the Products in the Vendor's price list,
                    Vendor will pass on the full benefit of the decrease to TBD.<br><br>
                    <strong>2. Product Images/Information:</strong> Vendor will make available to TBD, free of charge, all current
                    Product information, including electronic images, recommended retail prices, age ratings, any product safety
                    information required by applicable law to be displayed to consumers and Product information collected by TBD from
                    Vendor's website ("Product Information). Vendor will provide timely updates to the Product Information. Vendor grants
                    TBD a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable and royalty-free license for such period as the rights the Vendor has in
                    the Product Information subsist at law to: (a) use, copy and display the Product Information on or in connection with
                    any website (or similar ecommerce channel); (b) convert to digital electronic form, excerpt, reformat, adapt or
                    otherwise create derivative works of the Product Information; (c) use all trademarks or trade names included in the
                    Product Information; and (d) sublicense any of the foregoing rights for the purpose of marketing and promotion of the
                    Products.<br><br>
                    <strong>3. Warranties: Vendor represents and warrants that:</strong> (a) Products are safe, fit for purpose and free
                    from any defects; (b) Product Information is accurate and complete and that neither TBD's exercise of its license
                    rights, nor its sale, marketing or distribution of the Products, will violate any copyright, trademark, design,
                    database or other third party's rights; (c) Products, including Product Information and import documentation (if
                    applicable) comply with all applicable laws and rules and unless otherwise agreed, are CE compliant and are supplied
                    with all available European language versions of instructions and warranty and equipment (including, where relevant,
                    a plug suitable for the country of delivery of the Products); (d) the Products may be lawfully marketed, sold and
                    distributed without restriction; and (e) no Products were produced, manufactured, assembled, or packaged by forced,
                    prison or child labour (defined as age 15 or below or the minimum working age within the applicable jurisdiction,
                    whichever is older).<br><br>
                    <strong>4. Product Recalls; Product Returns; Effect of Remedies:</strong> Vendor will provide TBD immediate written
                    notice of any recall. Vendor is responsible for the reasonable costs TBD incurs in a recall. TBD may return for a
                    full refund at Vendor's expense any Product that (a) is damaged, defective, not fit for any purpose claimed by
                    Vendor (or a Product manufacturer) or breaches any warranty or representation in section 3; (b) does not conform
                    to agreed specifications or to samples; (c) is subject to recall; or (d) was not ordered in an OF by TBD. Where
                    TBD returns Product for any of the reasons set out in this section, Vendor will inspect any returned Products and
                    send written notice of any damages or shortages to TBD without delay. Vendor has a maximum of 6 months, from the
                    date of dispatch of the returned Product from TBD's premises, to challenge the right to return some or all of the
                    returned Product. Title to any Product returned to Vendor remains with TBD until Vendor has paid all monies related
                    to that returned Product. Payment of an invoice does not limit TBD's remedies.<br><br>
                    <strong>5. Vendor Defence and Indemnification:</strong> Vendor will defend TBD, its affiliated companies, and their
                    respective officers, directors, employees, contractors and agents (the "TBD Parties") against any claim that arises,
                    directly or indirectly, from: (a) any death of or injury to any person, damage to any property or any other damage
                    or loss due to any defect in or use of any Product; (b) any breach of the warranties in Section 3; (c) any Product
                    recall; (d) Vendor's negligence, strict liability or intentional misconduct; and (e) Vendor's breach of this
                    Agreement (individually, a "Claim", and collectively, the "Claims"). Vendor will indemnify and hold harmless
                    each TBD Party against any liability, loss, damage, cost or expense (including reasonable professional fees)
                    incurred by that TBD Party relating to any Claim, except to the extent the liability is caused by the negligence
                    or intentional misconduct of that TBD Party as determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court having
                    jurisdiction. Vendor will not consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise
                    of any Claim without the TBD Parties' prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. Vendor
                    will use counsel reasonably satisfactory to the TBD Parties, and the TBD Parties will cooperate in the defence.
                    If any TBD Party reasonably determines that any Claim might have an adverse effect on any TBD Party, that TBD
                    Party may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, take control of the defence at its expense (without
                    limiting Vendor's indemnification obligations).<br><br>
                    <strong>6. Limitation of Liability:</strong> NO TBD PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO VENDOR FOR ANY INDIRECT,
                    CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (ALL OF WHICH TERMS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PURE ECONOMIC LOSS,
                    LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, DEPLETION OF GOODWILL AND SIMILAR LOSS).<br><br>
                    <strong>7. Shipping:</strong> The parties will agree which party will be responsible for transportation
                    of the Products to TBD. When TBD is responsible for transportation, Vendor will deliver the Products to
                    TBD's designated carrier and risk of damage to or loss of the Products will pass to TBD when Vendor delivers
                    the Products to the carrier. When Vendor is responsible for transportation, risk of damage to or loss of
                    the Products will pass to TBD when it accepts the Products from Vendor's designated carrier and Vendor will
                    follow TBD's delivery procedures and requirements. Vendor retains title to Products until TBD has paid for
                    those Products. However, Vendor may not require TBD to dispose of the Products, rescind the transaction,
                    prohibit TBD from moving, selling and transferring good title to its customers or otherwise using the Products
                    in the ordinary course of business. Moreover, Vendor has no other rights than recovery of the Products in TBD's
                    stock if TBD defaults in its payment obligation for the Products due to insolvency.<br><br>
                    <strong>8. Insurance:</strong> Vendor will comply with Schedule 1 in respect of insurance requirements.<br><br>
                    <strong>9. Confidential Information:</strong> Vendor will: (a) protect TBD's information that is identified as
                    confidential or that reasonably should be considered confidential; (b) use this information only to fulfil
                    its obligations under this Agreement; and (c) return this information to TBD promptly when this Agreement
                    terminates. Section 9 covers all confidential information regardless of when Vendor receives it. Vendor will
                    not use any trademark, service mark, commercial symbol, or other proprietary right of any TBD Party; issue
                    press releases or other publicity relating to TBD or this Agreement; or refer to TBD in promotional materials.<br><br>
                    <strong>10. Miscellaneous:</strong> The parties agree that the Agreement may be validly concluded online.
                    These terms and conditions along with any addendums, agreements under which Vendor ships Products directly
                    to TBD and all commercial terms agreed in writing (including online) between the parties (together
                    "the Agreement") will form the entire agreement between TBD and Vendor for the purchase and sale of
                    Products and supersede all prior agreements and discussions relating to the same. Conflicting provisions,
                    in particular (but not limited to) those contained in Vendor's general terms and conditions, will only
                    apply if TBD explicitly agrees to such provisions in writing. The term of this Agreement is for the
                    calendar year in which it is signed by the parties. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive
                    calendar years on the same terms and conditions unless superseded by another written agreement between the
                    parties or unless terminated, without recourse to the courts, by either party giving 60 days' written notice
                    to the other at any time. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10 will survive termination of the Agreement.
                    Vendor may only assign or otherwise transfer the Agreement with TBD's prior written consent. TBD may
                    collect and process personal data from Vendor, and/or its representatives or employees, for the purposes
                    of communicating about, and developing, the mutual business relationship, complying with legal obligations
                    and generally giving effect to the terms of the Agreement. Any such personal data shall be collected and
                    processed in accordance with the principles detailed in TBD's privacy policy. This Agreement will be
                    interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of England and Wales without reference to any applicable
                    conflict of laws or the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. TBD and Vendor submit
                    to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England. TBD's estimates or forecasts are non-binding.
                    TBD may withhold or setoff any sums Vendor owes to TBD against sums owed by TBD to Vendor. TBD may request
                    from Vendor documents to enable it to verify payments made in accordance with this Agreement. If Vendor does
                    not provide such documents within a reasonable period, TBD will be free to deduct any outstanding amount
                    from Vendor's next remittance. The exercise of one or more rights or remedies by a party will not preclude
                    it from exercising any other right or remedy. TBD may communicate any modification of the Agreement via email.
                    Except as provided for in section 1, Vendor may reject the modifications. If TBD does not receive
                    Vendor's rejection within 14 days after notification, these modifications will be deemed to have been
                    accepted and will become part of the Agreement. Either party's failure to enforce any provision will
                    not be a waiver of the party's rights to subsequently enforce the provision. If any provision is held to
                    be invalid, then that provision will be modified to the extent necessary to give effect to the commercial
                    intentions of the parties and to make it enforceable, and any invalidity will not affect the remaining
                    provisions. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts.
                    Addresses for Notices to TBD:
                    60 Holborn Viaduct, London, EC1A 2FD
                    Attn: Commercial Department</p><br><br>
                <p><strong>Schedule 1</strong><br>
                    Insurance<br>
                    1. Any non-Media Vendor will obtain and maintain, at its expense, Public Third Party Liability insurance
                    coverage of, after conversion into pounds sterling, at least Â£1million per occurrence and Â£2 million
                    aggregate (except that, if the Products include any of the product types listed in clause 4 of this
                    Schedule 1, Vendor's coverage must be at least the amounts shown for such product types),. This coverage
                    must be maintained for twelve (12) months after the expiration of this Agreement. Media is defined as
                    books, music, video games, film, TV and software Products.  If the Media is accompanied with a non-Media
                    product (e.g. figurine, toy), then the combined product will be considered non-Media.<br>.
                    2. The required minimum limits of insurance may be satisfied by any combination of primary and
                    excess/umbrella liability insurance policies. Each of these coverages shall be primary and non-contributory
                    to any such coverage carried by TBD. Vendor will include "The Book Depository Limited and its affiliates
                    and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents" as "Indemnity to Principal" and Vendor
                    will provide TBD with 30 days' advance notice of cancellation, significant modification or expiration
                    of such insurance coverage.<br>
                    3. Vendor will promptly provide a certificate of insurance to TBD's Risk Management upon TBD's request,
                    Attn: Risk Management, The Book Depository Limited, 60 Holborn Viaduct, London, EC1A 2FD. TBD's
                    approval of Vendor's insurance does not relieve Vendor of any obligations, including but not limited
                    to its defence and indemnity obligations, even for claims over Vendor's policy limits. If Vendor
                    fails to perform any of its obligations in Schedule 1, TBD may withhold payment owed to Vendor until
                    Vendor meets these obligations.</p>
